1.  The cow represents a person who believes in a certain good, as in a kind of faith or religion, or even if it does not refer to neither, then a set of moral values.

2.  The tiger represents the opposite, i.e. the person who does not adhere to or follow a set of moral values or does not believe in a certain faith or religion and shuns either in the belief that there is no higher power.

3.  I believe that I do have a master with me, in this case the master being the belief system that I uphold and the faith and religion that I believe in.

4.  The mud in the story represents an experience or a problem that comes into ones life, wherein the person is challenged with a question as what to do in this situation. Similar to how the mud traps both the cow and the tiger, people in life, believers or not, are faced with problems wherein the trap is the lure to do the wrong thing but the belief system i.e. the master helps the cow out of the mud, which is saying that having a moral belief lets people choose the right thing to do and thus extricates them from the problem.

5.  I believe that the chase represents something akin to innocent, good people being put to suffering by those who do not possess a moral compass.

1. 
	- The primary difference: both files are a variable-sized sequence of bits, but bits in text file represent characters, while bits in binary file represent some other form of data which may/may not include text
	- in a way, text files are also binary files, but are encoded in special manner
	- encodings include UTF-8, UTF-16, ASCII, EBCDIC etc.
	- text files store only text and its metadata (such as formatting)
	- but binary files can store all kinds of data including text, such as multimedia, executables, and so on.

2.
  a)
	- ELF refers to Executable and Linkable Format
	- can be normal executables, relocatable object files, core dumps, and library objects
	- ELF files contain header, followed by a program header table and then section header table
	- in between these tables sections are present, such as .rodata, .text and .data
	- magic number is 0x7F
	- extensions include .elf, .o, .prx, .so and more
  b)
	- Hex dump is the binary-level dump of any file
	- usually represented in hexadecimal format or any format of liking
	- usually used for debugging, forensics and reverse engineering

3.
	- Hex dump usually shows binary data
	- in case of executables, sections of data shown
	- similar in case of process dumps, sections of memory pertaining to the process shown like the stack, heap etc.
	- for regular files, just binary level data and its character representation shown

4.
	- Big endian representation:

		---------------------
		|    |    |    |    |
		| DE | AD | BE | EF |
		|    |    |    |    |
		---------------------

	-Little endian representation:

		---------------------
		|    |    |    |    |
		| EF | BE | AD | DE |
		|    |    |    |    |
		---------------------

## What the submission contains

The submission contains four folders:

* section-1 : Contains the answers to the questions in the first section of the assignment.
* section-2-rip_port : Contains the report of the tasks done in the second section, and its relevant outputs.
* section-2-tryouts : Contains the files which were obtained as the results of the tasks done in the second section.
* section-2-code_bass : Contains the programs required to be implemented in the second section.

## Notes about section-2-code_bass

* All the programs required are included, including a stub program to just output the hex dump, should one need it to verify the output files at any stage.
* There are two versions to the virus program, a full fledged version and a miniature version, which should be apparent from the names of the executables and the source files. Due to some quirks in the logic of the full-fledged version, the full-fledged version is incomplete. So do use the alternate version (note that the alternate version does also implement all the functionality that is required.) whenever needed.
* The compilation is as simple as a single 'make' command. 

That's about it!

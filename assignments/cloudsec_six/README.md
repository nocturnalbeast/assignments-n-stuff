# [Security in the Cloud - Assignment 6](https://github.com/nocturnalbeast/assignments-n-stuff/tree/sem_two/assignments/cloudsec_six)

## Apache Hadoop

### Contents

The assignment submission contains four folders:

* inputs - contains the sample inputs passed to the jobs
* programs - contains the original Apache WordCount example and the modified LogIPCount example
* screenshots - contains screenshots of the entire process, starting from compilation to the extraction of the completed jobs
* outputs - contains the extracted outputs of the jobs from HadoopFS

### Execution

To run this, there is a Bash scriptlet made, which will do everything for you.

Simply run the following commands:

```
chmod +x runme.sh
./runme.sh
```

Alternatively, you can choose to open up `runme.sh` and execute each command one-by-one.

#### That's all, folks!
